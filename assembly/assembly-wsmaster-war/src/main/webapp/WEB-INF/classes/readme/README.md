Welcome to Eclipse Che. Che is a browser IDE and developer workspace server that allows anyone to contribute to a project without having to install software.

Workspaces are composed of projects (files) and environments (runtimes). Workspace configuration is persisted as versionable assets used to create portable replicas. Migrate workspace projects and runtimes to other Che instances, whether localhost or in the cloud. Receiving systems use the configuration to create an identical workspace state matching the source system. Che manages your workspace lifecycle, both orchestrating project state and booting / suspending / imaging / stopping / destroying workspace runtime environments.

Welcome to Eclipse Che. 

This Che workspace includes project code (on the left) and runtimes (at the bottom) and can be moved from machine-to-machine or user-to-user. Workspaces use containers and web services to bring repeatability, consistency, and performance to the developer environment.

You have a root-access terminal at the bottom and all project files are synced between the browser IDE and the workspace container. Alternatively you can SSH into the container or even mount and sync with your local filesystem.

You can read more about Che on our [site](https://eclipse.org/che/) and in our [docs](https://eclipse-che.readme.io/docs/). 

Che is an open source project under the Eclipse Foundation that's named after Cherkasy Ukraine, the city where development started.
